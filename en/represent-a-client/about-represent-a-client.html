<h2 id="section6">What's new</h2>
<h3>Submit documents changes in My Trust Account</h3>
<p>The following changes have been made to the Submit documents service in My Trust Account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Applications for a trust account number are no longer accepted through the Submit documents service. These applications must now be submitted as part of the T3 online registration process.</li>
    <li>Trust representatives can now send audit documents online in My Trust Account using the solicited document flow related to a T3 return.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transition to online mail for businesses</h3>
<p>The CRA is transitioning to online mail as the default method for businesses to receive most of their correspondence. This means businesses will begin receiving notices and other correspondence through My Business Account instead of in the mail. This change will roll out in two phases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1 – May 12, 2025:</strong> New business and program account registrations</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2 – June 16, 2025:</strong> Existing businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses that want to continue receiving paper mail will need to make a request to activate paper mail and will need to keep their mailing address up-to-date. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/about-business-account/online-mail-for-business.html">Online mail for business</a>.</p>
