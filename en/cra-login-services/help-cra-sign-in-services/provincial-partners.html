<p>A provincial partner uses a type of government-issued identification to sign in. Currently, this sign-in option is only available to residents of British Columbia and Alberta.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Who can use a provincial partner</h2>
<p>To register with this option, you must have:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-xs">
    <li class="cnjnctn-col-60" "mrgn-tp-0">
        <p>An account with one of our provincial partners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BC Services Card</li>
            <li>Alberta.ca Account</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="cnjnctn-col-80" "mrgn-tp-0">
        <p>A social insurance number (SIN) to validate your identity the first time you sign in</p>
        <details>
            <summary>If you do not have a SIN</summary>
            <p>If you don't have a SIN, we will also accept:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A temporary tax number(TTN)</li>
                <li>An individual tax number (ITN)</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="mrgn-tp-xl">Registering with a provincial partner allows you to get immediate access to your CRA account with the same credentials you already own. You will not need to use the document verification service or a CRA security code to verify your identity.</p>
<p>You can register with your provincial partner even if you have not filed your taxes in the last 2&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>If you use a BC Services Card, you will not be required to enroll in multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
