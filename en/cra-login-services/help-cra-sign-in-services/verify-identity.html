<p>As an extra security measure, you must verify your identity to complete your registration. This is done to ensure the safety of your tax information. For representatives using Represent a Client, this is done to ensure the safety of your clients' tax information.</p>
<p>You can verify your identity either by using the document verification service or with a CRA security code. Once your identity is verified, you will have full access to your CRA account.</p>

    <li><a href="#section3">Get limited access in My Account before completing your identity verification</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Document verification service</h2>
<p>You can use the document verification service to verify your identity without waiting for a CRA security code, giving you full and immediate access to your CRA account.</p>
<p>Use a mobile device to take a real-time picture of yourself and an accepted government-issued photo identification document.</p>
<h3>Who can use this service</h3>
<p>To be eligible to use this service, you must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be 16 years of age or older</li>
    <li>Have an accepted government-issued photo identification</li>
    <li>Have a mobile device with a working camera</li>
</ul>
<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">If you are not able to use the document verification service, you can still verify your identity with a <a href="#section2">CRA security code</a>.</p>
<h3>Gather your identification documents</h3>
<p>The following original government-issued identification documents are accepted:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Canadian passport</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Canadian driver's license</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Provincial or territorial photo ID card</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not accept:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Provincial health cards</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Documents that have been reported as lost or stolen</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Expired or damaged documents</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Photocopies of documents</li>
    <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>Pictures of yourself that were not taken in real-time</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure the photos you submit are unobstructed (for example, the ID is fully visible and there is no glare).</p>
<h2 id="section2">CRA security code</h2>
<p>If you can't use the document verification service, you can choose to have a CRA security code mailed to you.</p>
<p>When you request a CRA security code, you will have to enter the postal code or ZIP code of your current mailing address. If your postal code doesn't match what we have on file, you will have to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html#assistance">contact us</a> to update your address.</p>
<p>If you live outside Canada and the United States, your postal code or ZIP code is not required.</p>
<h3>Get your CRA security code</h3>
<p>We will mail your CRA security code within <strong>10 business days</strong> to the physical address we have on file. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/change-your-address.html">Make sure your address is up to date</a>.</p>
<p>The CRA security code comes with an expiry date. Follow the instructions before the code expires, or you will have to request a new security code to be sent to you. Alternatively, you may be able to use the document verification service.</p>
<p>Once you get your CRA security code, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">sign in to your CRA account</a> and enter your CRA security code when prompted.</p>
<p>You may be able to use the document verification service if you have one of the following problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You lost your CRA security code</li>
    <li>You did not get your CRA security code</li>
    <li>You entered your CRA security code incorrectly too many times and got an error message that you have been locked out</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to use the document verification service, or if you prefer to receive another CRA security code by mail, you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html#assistance">contact us</a>.</p>
