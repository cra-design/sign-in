<h2 id="section3">Services in My Business Account</h2>
<p>After signing in to your CRA account, select your business from the Welcome page to access all the services available in My Business Account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/about-business-account/services-my-business-account.html">List of services available in My Business Account</a></p>
<p>For details about our hours of service and browser requirements, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/help-cra-sign-in-services/sign-in-services-availability.html">CRA account availability</a>.</p>
<h2 id="section4">Online mail for business</h2>
<p>Most correspondence is only available online in My Business Account by default, except when a business has changed its delivery method to receive paper mail. Make sure you register for email notifications from the CRA to find out when you have new mail to view in My Business Account.</p>
<p>For more details, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/about-business-account/online-mail-for-business.html">Online mail for business</a></p>
<h2 id="section5">What's new</h2>
<h3>Changes to GST/HST account closure rules</h3>
<p>You can no longer close a GST/HST account within two years of activation. If you attempt to close the account before the two-year mark, an error message will appear directing you to contact Business enquiries for further assistance.</p>
<h3>Link a Business Number with your social insurance number</h3>
<p>You are now able to link a Business Number (BN) with your social insurance number (SIN) without calling the CRA by adding it on your CRA account. If you already have another business on file, you can add a new BN from your My Business Account profile page. If you do not have another business on file, you can add a new BN from the Welcome page of your CRA account.</p>
<h3>Progress Tracker updates</h3>
<p>The Progress Tracker has been updated to allow you to track the progress of returns, refunds, and amended returns for Other Levies programs.</p>
<h3>Transition to online mail for businesses</h3>
<p>The CRA is transitioning to online mail as the default method for businesses to receive most of their correspondence. This means businesses will begin receiving notices and other correspondence through My Business Account instead of in the mail. This change will roll out in two phases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1&nbsp;– May&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2025</strong>: New business and program account registrations</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2&nbsp;– June&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2025</strong>: Existing businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses that want to continue receiving paper mail will need to make a request to activate paper mail and will need to keep their mailing address up-to-date. For more information, go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/about-business-account/online-mail-for-business.html">Online mail for business</a>.</p>
